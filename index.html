            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">If you are very hungry, in Czech that means you are hungry like a wolf - mám hlad jako vlk. If you're hungry, everything tastes ten times better because hlad je nejlep¹í kuchaø - hunger is the best cook (or hunger is the best sauce, as the English saying goes). Then you are the ultimate food lover.
                Our food love and food habits might shake our budgets and make our weight gain go crazy, but the peace food provides is uncomparable. Apart from keeping our bodies alive and going, we, as food lovers might as well just quote that food is also keeping our souls and happiness alive. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">You know when you start walking beside a stranger and you accidentally step into line with them and happen to be walking at the same speed, but when you walk faster, they walk faster, and then as they slow down you slow down? And then it gets so awkward you just stop walking... and hop off the treadmill.“Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.” -Ernestine Ulmer
                “Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all.” -Harriet van HorneIn particular, I've had the option to help entrepreneurs by adding their areas to the guide, and I'm ready to help their potential clients by leaving a review to help control their choices </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Like poetry and literature are food for the soul, chocolate and cheese must be soul food for the stomach. Are you someone who keeps chocolates in books to use it as a bribe to study or someone whose midnight snack supply is more important than the night sleep schedule? Are you the one who prefers surprise food deliveries over surprise birthday apparels or someone who spends more money on food than anything else? </p>
